# ⚡ SmartEnergy - Smart Power Allocation & Monitoring System

SmartEnergy is a web-based energy management system designed for small residential estates powered by solar and/or wind energy. It allows **administrators** to simulate energy generation and consumption conditions, and enables **tenants (clients)** to monitor their energy use and control loads like fans, TVs, and refrigerators in real time.

## 🚀 Purpose & Main Aim

The project aims to:
- Promote fair, optimized usage of renewable energy within shared environments.
- Prevent energy waste by allocating power daily based on availability.
- Empower users to monitor and manage their consumption independently.
- Simulate real-world conditions like cloudy/sunny/rainy weather to determine power generation impact.
